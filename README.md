# Image Encryption Project

The Image Encryption Project is an innovative cybersecurity endeavor designed to ensure the secure transmission and storage of sensitive visual data. This project employs advanced cryptographic algorithms to transform images into unintelligible ciphertext, rendering them unreadable to unauthorized individuals.

## Features

- **Image Encryption:** Encrypts images using strong cryptographic algorithms.
- **Security Enhancement:** Enhances security by rendering images unreadable to unauthorized users.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
- **Instant Feedback:** Displays real-time feedback on the encryption process.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python (and any required libraries) installed.
3. Run the `Image_Encryption.py` script.
4. Select an image file to encrypt.
5. Observe the encrypted image and any relevant feedback.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.10)
- Required libraries (e.g., `tkinter`, `PIL`, `cryptography`)
